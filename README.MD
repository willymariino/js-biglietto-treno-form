This project was developed as an early exercise in form handling using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It consists of a simple interface that collects user input—name, age, and travel distance—and dynamically calculates the price of a train ticket. 
The application applies the standard rate of **€0.20 per kilometer**, with automatic discounts based on the user’s age.
